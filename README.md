It has a complex structure and bypasses Battleye automatically, which causes it to behave bizarrely. It is recognised as malware!
Be sure to turn off your antivirus!

Battleye Bypass is activated after entering the warp gate
DayBreak patched the Battleye bypass function before Planetside 2 launches, so I have found that there is a few dozen seconds after launch where I can bypass BE.
When BE detects suspicious activity, it logs it to a Log file and sends the log data to the server, so don't let it communicate with the server!
Block the BE with the Windows Firewall before launching the hack.
I do not take any responsibility arising from this tool
Use at your own risk!
